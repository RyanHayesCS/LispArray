"
	This is a program to create and manipulate multi-dimensional arrays in Lisp.

	The program contains two main files, array.lisp and driver.lisp.
	array.lisp contains four main functions that:
	1. create a multidimensional array
	2. return the specified dimension of an array
	3. return the item in a specified spot in the array
	4. return a copy of the array with a change made to the specified spot
		of the old array.

	driver.lisp runs these functions to demonstrate how they work.

	View driver.lisp in order to help understand the syntax for calling
	the array.lisp functions.
